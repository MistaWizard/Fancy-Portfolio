# Updated Portfolio

## Portfolio V3
I have updated my Portfolio to include some of our latest projects and homeworks. I have stuck with the same overall design but have implemented some improvements to enhance the feel of the site. Portfolio links have been redone and now have a :hover overlay to show the links to the live version of the item and the GitHub link. Image sizes for the portfolio items have been reduced, two are present on a row and now it is more mobile responsive and items wrap on smaller screens. Navbar toggler is now on the right for smaller displays and the background color has been changed slightly.
